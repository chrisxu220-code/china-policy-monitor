# 🇨🇳 China Tech Policy Monitor | Structural Topic Modeling (STM) Dashboard

An interactive NLP dashboard designed to quantify and visualize shifts in Chinese industrial policy. This tool leverages a pre-trained **Structural Topic Model (STM)** to map unseen government documents against 74 distinct policy topics (e.g., "Made in China 2025", "Green Energy", "R&D Financing").

Built with **R Shiny**, this project features an automated model provisioning architecture that decouples the heavy model weights from the codebase, ensuring a lightweight and reproducible repository.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Automated Model Provisioning:** The application automatically detects if the pre-trained model weights (200MB+) are missing and securely downloads them from GitHub Releases upon the first launch.
* **Real-time NLP Scoring:** Upload any new policy document (Excel/CSV), and the system uses `fitNewDocuments` to project it onto the existing 74-dimensional topic space.
* **Advanced Chinese Pre-processing:** Integrated `jiebaR` segmentation pipeline with custom stop-word removal, regex cleaning for administrative terms (e.g., "省", "市"), and temporal filtering.
* **Thematic Aggregation:** Automatically aggregates micro-topics into 12 macro-strategic groups (e.g., "Research & Development", "Tech Commercialization").

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Core Logic:** R Language
* **Web Framework:** R Shiny
* **NLP & Modeling:** `stm` (Structural Topic Model), `jiebaR` (Chinese Segmentation), `quanteda`
* **Data Manipulation:** `tidyverse`, `stringi`

(Note: The models/ folder is NOT in the repo. It will be automatically created on your local machine to store the .RData file when you first run the app.)

## 💻 Installation & Usage
**Prerequisites**
R (Version 4.0 or higher)
RStudio (Recommended)

## **Quick Start**
You do not need to manually download the large model file. The script handles it for you.
**1. Clone the repository:**
Bash
git clone [https://github.com/chrisxu220-code/china-policy-monitor.git](https://github.com/chrisxu220-code/china-policy-monitor.git)
**2. Open the project in RStudio: **Open app.R. RStudio usually prompts to install missing packages (shiny, stm, jiebaR, etc.). If not, run this in the console:
R
install.packages(c("shiny", "tidyverse", "jiebaR", "stm", "readxl", "writexl", "quanteda", "stringi"))
**3. Run the App:** Click the "Run App" button in RStudio.
Note: On the very first run, check the R console. You will see a message: "Model file not found. Downloading from GitHub Releases...". Wait for the download to finish (approx. 200MB).
**4. Upload Data:** Upload an Excel (.xlsx) or CSV file.
Requirement: The file must contain a column named Content which stores the Chinese text.

## **🔍 Methodology**
**Segmentation:** Raw text is segmented using jiebaR with a specialized dictionary focused on Chinese policy terminology.
Cleaning: Regex filters remove administrative noise (e.g., "Year 2025" vs "Made in China 2025"), location names, and non-semantic characters.
**Transfer Learning:** Instead of retraining the model, we use the STM fitNewDocuments function to infer the topic distribution (θ) of the new documents based on the vocabulary and priors of the pre-trained model.
